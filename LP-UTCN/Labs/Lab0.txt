1.2.Quiz exercises
1.2.1 Which is the nature of the following Prolog terms:
a. X - variable
b.'X' - atom 
c._138 - variable
d.hello -atom
e.Hello -variable
f.'Hello' -atom 
g.[a,b,c] - a list of atoms
h.[A,B,C] - a list of variables
i.[Ana, are, 'mere'] - a list of variables and atoms

1.2.3 Execute the following unification queries. Explain the results in a text file:
a. ?- a = a.
true - constants unify with themselves and atoms unify if and only they are the same atom
b. ?- a = b.
false - atoms unify if and only they are the same atom
c. ?- 1 = 2.
false - numbers unify if and only they are the same number
d. ?- 'ana' = 'Ana'.
false - strings unify if and only they are the same
e. ?- X = 1, Y = X.
X=Y Y=1 - X is instantiated to 1 and Y is instantiated to X
f. ?- X = 3, Y = 2, X = Y.
false - X is instantiated to 3 and Y is instantiated to 2, they are not compatible
g. ?- X = 3, X = Y, Y = 2.
false - X is instantiated to 3, Y is instantiated already to X, it can not be instantiated to 2
h. ?- X = ana.
X = ana - X is unified to atom ana
i. ?- X = ana, Y = 'ana', X = Y.
X=Y Y=ana , X and Y are instantiated to the same atom 
j. ?- a(b,c) = a(X,Y).
X=b
Y=c
-a compound term is unified with another compound term if X is instantiated to b and Y to c
k. ?- a(X,c(d,X)) = a(2,c(d,Y)).
X=Y, Y=2
-a compound term is unified with another compound term if X is instantiated to Y and Y to 2(because in this way X will be instantiated to 2)  
l. ?- a(X,Y) = a(b(c,Y),Z).
X=b(c,Y)
Y=Z
-a compound term is unified with another compound term if X is instantiated to b(c,Y) and Y to Z.
m. ?- tree(left, root, Right) = tree(left, root, tree(a, b, tree(c, d, e))).
Right = tree(a, b, tree(c, d, e)). 
-a strucuture is unified with another one if the term Right is instantiated to tree(c,d,e)
n. ?- k(s(g),t(k)) = k(X,t(Y)).
X = s(g),
Y = k.
-the compound term k is unified with another one if X is instantiated to a compound term s(g) and Y to atom k.
o. ?- father(X) = X.
X = father(X).
-X is unified with a compound term 
p. ?- loves(X,X) = loves(marsellus,mia).
-false - because X can not be unified to two atoms.
q. ?- [1, 2, 3] = [a, b, c].
-false - because lists unify if their heads and tails unify. (numbers and atoms)
r. ?- [1, 2, 3] = [A, B, C].
A=1
B=2
C=3
-lists can unify if each variable is instantiated to a number from right side
s. ?- [abc, 1, f(x) | L2] = [abc|T].
T = [1, f(x)|L2] - lists can unify if their heads and tails are the same.
-if T = [1, f(x)|L2] then the list will be [abc|1,f(x)|L2]= [abc, 1, f(x)|L2]
t. ?- [abc, 1, f(x) | L2] = [abc, 1, f(x)].
L2 = [] -lists can unify if their heads and tails are the same, so L2 should be an empty list
